# Follow the first link of Wikipedia

This is a simple python scripts which scrapes a wikpedia article and then recursively follows the first link of the article. I just wanted to test the hypotheses that the following the first link will eventually lead me to the article "philosophy". But it didn't for me. In this case, it eventually led me to the article "latin" in all the cases. But If I follow the fourth link of "latin" article, it will eventually lead me to "philosophy". I don't know why "philosophy" was the convergent article mentioned on the web but I think it might have changed since the articles keep on changing all the time. Maybe, "latin" is the convergent article now.
